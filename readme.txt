Track your WordPress Core Updates, Plugin Updates, and Theme Updates. View update statistics and send an HTML email report to your clients.

== Description ==

The perfect report builder plugin for agencies and site maintainers who regularly update WordPress including its themes and plugins on a weekly, monthly, or quarterly basis. The plugin tracks what daily updates have happened and records them.

You can use the beautiful reporting analytics page to show what updates have happened within a certain amount of time such as last month, this month, or last 30 days.

Send an HTML email with update statistics whenever you complete updates to show the value of your work to your client or other site stakeholders.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where Are My Past Updates? =

WordPress by default does not track when updates have happened. WP Client Reports adds the functionality to do that, but that means that it cannot report on updates that happened before the plugin was installed.

= Can I Modify the Reports? =

With this basic version there isn't a lot to customize. We are working on adding functionality to the free version and may explore the idea of a pro version of the plugin as well with additional functionality.
