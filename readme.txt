== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where Are My Past Updates? =

WordPress by default does not track when updates have happened. WP Client Reports adds the functionality to do that, but that means that it cannot report on updates that happened before the plugin was installed.

= Can I Modify the Reports? =

With this basic version there isn't a lot to customize. We are working on adding functionality to the free version and may explore the idea of a pro version of the plugin as well with additional functionality.
