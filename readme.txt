Send professional client maintenance report emails, including software update statistics for plugins, themes, and WordPress.

== Description ==

Deliver confidence and prove your value routinely to clients and stakeholders.

== Client Website Maintenance Reports ==

The perfect maintenance report builder plugin for agencies, freelancers and site maintainers who update their client's sites on a weekly, monthly, or quarterly basis. The plugin tracks what updates have happened and records them daily.

You can use the cleanly designed reporting analytics screen to show the updates that have happened within amounts of time such as last month, this month, last 30 days, or a custom length.

Send a professional looking email including update statistics whenever you complete updates to show the value of your work to your client or other site stakeholders. No PDF's here, just a nicely designed email.

== Pro Version ==

[WP Client Reports Pro](https://switchwp.com/plugins/wp-client-reports/?utm_source=wporg&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=pro) allows you to self brand the maintenance report email with your logo and company color. It also adds a number of optional integrations with other services and plugins to display their statistics.

- Google Analytics
- Gravity Forms & Ninja Forms
- Uptime Robot & Pingdom
- Mailchimp
- WooCommerce

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/wp-client-reports` directory, or install the zipped plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the WP Client Reports plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Use the Settings->WP Client Reports screen to configure the default settings.
4. Use the Dashboard->Reports screen to view update statistics.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where Are My Past Updates? =

WordPress by default does not track when updates have happened. WP Client Reports adds the functionality to do that, but that means that it cannot report on updates that happened before the plugin was installed.

= Can I Modify the Reports? =

With this basic version there isn't a lot to customize. We are working on adding functionality to the free version and may explore the idea of a pro version of the plugin as well with additional functionality.
